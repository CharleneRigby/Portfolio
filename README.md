My newly redesigned portfolio website.
(Still working on it though :D)

### How It Works

  * There are three black tabs in the upper right corner that show my social links (Resume, Git, Email) when the cursor hovers over the tabs.

  * There are five color tabs on the left side of the page that show links to things I have created during the coding bootcamp course (psychic game, game collector, trivia game, giftastic, train scheduler) when the cursor hovers over the tabs.
